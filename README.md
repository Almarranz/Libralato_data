# Libralato_data
Analisis of Libralato et al data
## on branch: main
### Branch main follows the paper of Libralato et al. 2021 for the selection of the good data, and uses the scripts erro_Mc for the transformatipm of the galactic coordenates and errors afterwards
0. error_Mc.py. Transform coordinates to galactic and apply a MC method for uncertainties . This script is run on the imac becouse it takes forever. 
1. galactic_pm_catalog.py. Adds the galactic proper motions computed in error_Mc.py to the LibralatosÂ´s proper motion catalog. NOt intirely sure why I did a specific script just for this.
2. well_measured.py. Select well measured stars following the criteria in Libralato et al. 2021, for the **photometric** catalogs (Except for the criteria f, that I dont know how to implement). *Have to be run for epoch 1 and 2 separatly*
> note: you can choose whatever or not you what to trimmed your data. If you dont trimmit at all, the list generated by this scripts will have the word *relaxed* in front in the name
3. well_measured_PM.py. Apply a couple more of condition from Libralto et al for PM selection. It returns a list with the selected stars: their proper motion and their magnitude mF139.
> Note: you can select the trimmed or the untrimmed data
> Note: you can choose whatever or not you what to trimmed your data further. If you dont trimmit at all, the list generated by this scripts will have the word *relaxed* in front in the name

___
4. After step 2 you have to go to TopCat and cross match the NSD central region catalog, with the list retrived for step 2. (IN format CVS-non header)
___

5. co_mouving_group.py Generates lists and plots of the stars aroun the Ms stars found in the refined data. 
6. DBSCAN_tests.py. Runs DBSCAN on the lists generated by #5 script.
